# PortalEscape
## About ####
- My first ever game I created on my own in Unity. 
- The goal of the game is to reach the portal to teleport to the next level and eventually escape the maze.
- I had a strong focus on creating a simplistic and consistent color theme throughout the game.

## Controls ##
- **Move Left:** A or LEFT key.
- **Move Right:** D or RIGHT key.
- **Jump:** SPACE key.

## Game Mechanics ##
- When you reach a portal, it will teleport you to the next level.
- Enemies move in a tracking motion either vertically or horizontally.
- The player can climb the upward-arrow blocks.
